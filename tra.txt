Visit MIT OpenCourseWare at ocw.mit.edu. You >> Good afternoon. Congratulations for braving it through what has now become a weekly snow disaster this week's maybe three of them or something. My name is John Gabrielli. This is introductory to psychology at 900. This is a course about you. the entire course is, what do we understand in a scientific way? about human nature, how people's minds work, how people's brains work that supports their minds. This entire course is about what's a scientific way to understanding how people feel. think and act in the world and so it's a we're going to try to that we constantly think you must in your everyday life think about you know why You have your preferences, your desires, what's easy for you, what's hard for you, what's delightful for you. Why do other people behave the way they do? How do they think? And so there's a lot of realms of this that are tough to get to by science. We're going to focus on this semester is, you know, where's the scientific approach, the shed light? in the way that we're used to in thinking about experiments and evidence about how humans tick. And as we go through this semester, we'll talk about the brain. I'll talk a fair bit about chapters from this book, the man whom has took his wife for a hat. It was a bestseller, even when it wasn't a sign for a course, it's a great book. enjoy it. Sure, really fun chapters. We'll talk about about how we perceive the world, how we see, especially a little bit of how we hear, how we think, how we feel. feel, personality, how we differ from one to the other, and what we sort of like, and how we-- development from childhood and infancy through adolescence through young adulthood where you are mostly through getting older. I am social interaction, how we behave in groups and think about other people. And variation in mental health or psychopathology and increasing what we understand And that there's a huge number of people who at some moment in their life, or another, struggle with some aspect of mental health. And then we'll focus a lot on not only psychological aspects of that, what we said in terms of behavior, but also the brain bases that and think a little bit about to what extent the mind is what the brain does. and the mind is what the brain does. And so for every dimension of being a human being that will... We'll also talk about what we understand currently from the neurological and neuroscientific literature. about how the human brain supports and contributes to different aspects of being a person. So, you know, everybody who's a sort of a, works a certain things that their field is really, really, really special, right? So here's why psychology is really really, really special. So it's really, really special. I think most of all... Because every endeavor that we undertake at a university or or in society as a whole. It's about people, right? Except for when we think about the rest of it. But, you know, people study biology, chemistry, and physics. They think that the sun orbits the Earth. for some period of time, and then they think it's the other way around currently, right? Okay, so people come up with these conclusions, even though we're trying to understand nature, it's people who, make certain investments in economics or behave in a certain way, or vote in a certain way. It's people who make music and appreciate music, make art and appreciate art. Read and write literature right so in all these dimensions. There's something fundamental about what it is about the human mind that gives birth to these areas of inquiry. and how those areas, domains of human experience, are enacted. So, my only goal today is to try to convince you in a number of different ways. that we're not simple video camera in our minds. between our ears, recording the world in some objective, simple way, that even the simplest, most awesome. These obvious things are interpretations of the world around us at many different levels of thought and feeling. And there are minds, the way our minds are constructed determines the world that we expect. experience that we see, that we octicon, and even very simple things that we think are Pretty adorable. and simple, right in front of our eyes, are determined by inferences and deductions that are Mind makes weighing sources of evidence in the world and coming to conclusions about what's around us, what we hear, and what we see, and how we think. So let's start with seeing. If your vision is reasonable, you know, we say we see something, we believe it, right? So let's start with something very simple, these lines. So one of the- the tough things about psychology. Ever since the internet came into existence. People know every cool thing there is to know, right? Okay, so I can tell you. You know, when I began teaching, like people said, oh my gosh, I've never seen such a thing. It's unbelievable, you know. Now it's like too thick to the clock. Yeah, I've got that, you know, on my computer at home. And yeah, all right, we did that like third grade or whatever. So I'm saying is enjoy the ones you haven't seen before. Don't ruin it. your neighbors today because it's harder and harder to surprise the world in a nice way, right? OK, but let's look at these lines for a moment here. And perhaps you'll have the sense. And maybe it's a glaring-- Coming up there, sir, let's see if it can do something like that. OK, is that better? OK, maybe not. So, you know, you might have the sense that this line is a different length than this line, and this might be somewhere intermediate, right? Now, you know, because of psychology, it's all a trick. But that's what's simpler. than the length of a line. What's more objective in some sense than the length of a line, but if we look at the actual lengths. They're all literally identical, but that center part looks different. So what does it mean for-- or to look different. It means our minds are determining a simpler thing [BLANK_AUDIO] along aligners depending on the other information surrounding it. It's an interpretation. context. We're simply looking, the lines will look the same. Let's try another one. It's remarkable that those two lines are identical in length. All right, all right, all right, yeah, I can't, okay, I just, you know, so good to test limits of the credibility of the audience right all right yeah of course if our visual system would be constantly walking into walls and, you know, falling out windows and things like that. that, if we were to miss estimate and get that length. So the idea where we have visual illusions, and I'll show you some more. or that I think you'll be impressed by. It's not that our visual system is messed up. or that psychologists think it's hilarious to trick us. It's that lots of things are-- system is brilliant at, but it's brilliant by having certain laws or principles that follows, and we can show that it's following those principles by seeing that when we met... with the typical circumstances, those principles calculate the wrong answer. So, here's another one. So, to most people, which line looks bigger, the one in the middle or the one on the side. I know you know it's all a trick, right? OK. Yeah, what could be more obvious in that this is longer, it's just a simple line. If we draw red lines on top of them and move them over here, they're dead identical. central circle, this one of them, the middle circle, look larger than the other. Now, you already know-- intellectually that will turn out those two circles in the middle will be the same. But you have to convince yourself that it still looks like they're different. Here they are in red, here they are in red. next to each other, they're identical. Again, this is evidence that even for a simple thing, like the size of a circle, So your mind is making inferences, and there are principles and laws that it's following. to determine what it is you think you see. Here's two monsters chasing each other. But, in fact, they're identical in size. The perspective cues make the-- much bigger. This is from Ted Edelson. This is Ted Edelson. a beautiful demonstration of an illusion. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] in the psychology department. There's a letter A here, and believe it or not, the letter B there. Let's see if this looks any better when it goes like this. It doesn't. All right. So one of the important things about illusions, demonstrations in this class, and you Learn this as we go along as occasionally they fail. Then we come back and discover what the lesson of that is. I'm just telling you, I'm showing you my monitor much brighter and it always has before. we'll adjust that. So I'm gonna skip this, but I'll show you another time 'cause it's so good. that I'm going to feel bad about this. OK, well, let's see. This will work there, isn't it? (mellow music) All the same shade of grey, right? (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (audience laughing) Work reasonably from where you sat? OK. We'll try a few more. Maybe. For some reason my connection's always like this, sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Does that one look lighter than that one that way? - Yeah. [BLANK_AUDIO] Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. [coughing] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) now they look radically different right it's the same gray constantly but it Again, the context is hugely determining how bright you see that gray. There it is. (coughing)  Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (upbeat music) - Two. Boxes equal gray (upbeat music) (upbeat music) So, things as simple as how bright something is or how long something is. thing is depend on interpretation. Here's-- here's a-- here's a-- the illusion from Roger Shepard is kind of great. So here's two-- who kind of different looking tables, right? But they're not that different, and watch. There goes one tabletop.  You're not impressed, but those are identical tables. I'm gonna do it again. That's the identical table top. To me, the one on the left looks pretty ridiculous. Angular and then one of the right looks pretty squarish. No, you're not easy to impress, sir. [LAUGH] You see that those two bars are moving together. at the same time. Does it look like they're like little steps? It'll show you. I find like a-- it's just-- Just like that. But now you add those bars. Does it look like little steps? (audience laughing) One more of this kind. This is kind of fun. Well.  Do you see the way that mask is turning? It always looks like it's towards you, even though you know, on one of the rotations. So the way you're interpreting the light is influencing how you're interpreting what's-- OK. So that's simply a consequence as far as people... understand that, that the source of the illumination is not what you're used to, so you're misinterpreting. Where the illumination is coming from, for the depth of the face, what's front and what's back. That was a sticking, you know, sticking out. Okay. So. So again, the point in these illusions is even for very simple-- things. Our minds make certain assumptions about how we interpret the world. And that drives everything that we see and how we act upon that we see. So, and it's slightly sort of, higher or more conceptual level, I need your help. Now, there's lots of these things that we'll do this semester. where you get to participate. I mean, the fun thing about, you know, I said this question was about you when you could have thought that was a bit of a question. It's not. It's truly about you. So you get to be your own laboratory. where we get to share a laboratory sitting here. And what I'm going to do is ask for you to participate. You don't have to do-- any of these things sitting at your seat, but I think it's usually fun to do them. So. What's going to happen is I'm going to show you a drawing. and I'll see you in the next one. Let's look at-- with the people to my left, so about in the middle, but you can decide for yourself. about this way. Let's have you be group A if you're going to be that way. OK, all right, because of that, I can't call you. It's gonna call you guys group B, but I already see that's getting me in trouble. So we'll call it group B, but that really, means equals a, but I'll just call b, OK, all right? So a and b, OK? So what I need is group B, B for best, A for all. - Awesome, okay. The groupie. (laughing) Groupie to kind of clap. Close your eyes for a moment, okay? Group beats if you want to have fun with us. Close your eyes for a moment. You're going to see some instructions and read them silently to yourself. And then I'll ask you a question about the picture. Okay, group A. You're now reading Group B as your eyes closed. So read the instructions silently to yourself.  Now, group A, close your eyes, everybody has their eyes, close for a moment. Everybody has their eyes closed for a moment. closed. Now group B, look at your instructions. So A has her eyes closed. B is is reading instructions. Everybody's eyes are open now, everybody's open. guys are open. Here's your picture. So if take it in, I'm going to ask you a few questions about it. For a moment, inspect it. OK, here we go. Ready? So just out loud. Was there an automobile in the picture? Okay, see, this is a smart classroom. - All right. (laughs) Okay, was there a man in the picture? >> Was there a woman in the picture? >> Yes. >> Okay. This side again. Woman in the picture? >> No. >> Okay, all right, all right. >> [LAUGH] (laughing) Okay, a child? An animal? -Yes. -Ah, okay, all right. And now gets a little -- gets a little wild, okay? A whip? Okay. A sword? Alright, a man's hat, a ball, a ball, a ball, a ball. Fish? - Yes. - All right, so there's this agreement and that's, you know, it's, we're democracy, right? OK, so all these things are big setups, right? So here's where-- Happened, Group A was told they're going to look at a picture of a trained seal act. And group E got the identical instructions, but they were told you're going to look at a costume book. So you had an expectation of what you were going to see. that expectation drives your interpretation of the very thing you see next, which is this picture. Okay, all right (audience laughing) [ Laughter ] Okay, is that all right? Okay. All right, and you know this is just for fun, right? It's a setup, you're participating nicely. But in the world-- when groups that are arguing with each other about things like peace settlements. You know, read a document or make a statement. How much do you think the perspective they start? with guides the interpretation of what they read or what they hear, right? Because you didn't have big stakes in this. You weren't going, I believe in fish, and if I don't see a fish. Oh, I know things aren't Justin. My group will be not treated fairly, right? Okay? Emotionally invested in probably whether there was a fish present so You know, your interpretation, your beliefs guide tremendously what you think you-- see in how you interpret the situation, for complicated things or even easy things, like lines or squares. squares. And here's another kind of an example where you would interpret, you know, that B for Baker or 13 if it's in numbers. Again, the context is driving a lot of the interpretation. OK. Now, this is one of those examples. that, again, some number of years ago it was a huge And now mostly people say, can't you come up with something better that we haven't all seen on the Internet? So if you know this, don't ruin it for the other individual. But what I need is, I'm not going to be able to do this. a few volunteers you'll be facing me this way. say, we're willing to count something. And this-- He we're pretty good at counting. You So what was the? What's the message of that? The message is, we've talked about what we perceive, what we see by our-- expectations and context. But it's also, we have very limited what psychologists We can pay attention to a limited number of things at a time. And even when those things can be right in front of us, if our attention is focused or occupied by something else, like counting the passes in a kind of a difficult scene. It wouldn't work. if there was one or two passes only, because you do notice it. But when you're-- Behind is focused, and I'm identifying all the passes among the players in the White Shirts. They're moving, they're weaving. the other players and so on, then your attention is absorbed by the And some of it is not left over to notice what's right in front of you. And we'll talk more about that. huge thing with humans that we can pay attention pretty well on average to a thing a time under many circumstances and other things escape us completely even. if they're obviously present, if we were looking at them or paying attention to them. So, Here's another example of how our minds make our worlds, you know, what we see and what we don't see. pay attention to and what we don't pay attention to. And that's something to do with-- how we hear. [inaudible] Okay, so I'm going to replay this. I think. So listen to what the guy's saying and take a look and just tell me what he's going to say like he's saying some letters, okay, just not a word. What is it? Okay, most people think he's saying da, all right, okay, da, da, da, da, da, da, now. Let's try that again with I'm going to turn off the sound and I'm going to run the same - My film. What does his mouth look like it's saying? Gaga, okay? But now we'll do one more. thing which is turn the sound back on, have you close? Close your eyes and listen to what he's saying. - Bono, bono, bono, bono. - What's he saying? Bye, ah. So it doesn't work for everybody every time. But the basic idea is Most people think they hear the word daw coming from the speaker. and in fact in their mind they do because that's how they interpret what they're hearing but in The film clip is a film clip of the person saying, bah, bah, bah. And then an audio recording of the person saying, "Gah, gah, gah." Your mind intertwines across modalities what you hear. what you see integrates them in some way below the level of consciousness. You're not thinking about it. And you come up with a different interpretation of what you hear, right? What you see is one thing, what you hear is another thing when your eyes are open and your ears are open. They meld together and produce something, a third thing that's entirely differently. Again, you're mine. interpreting what you hear, not your ear interpreting what you hear in a simple sense. Okay, how about things that we know? Let's think about this, if somebody were to ask you, which is farther east, closer to the Atlantic? San Diego, California, or Reno, Nevada. Who likes San Diego as being farther east? A few hands. Who likes Reno's? farther east okay so here's the The mental map most people have, the mental map, which is, we know California is right next to the ocean. with Arnold Schwarzenegger protecting us on that side of the country, right? And then Nevada is a little bit more towards Boston, right? Okay, that's a mental map that most people have, and that's how the hands went up. This is the actual map. the only actual map you've ever seen, ever, on a globe, on a map, anything. Because-- California takes a big turn on the south. San Diego is actually further east than Reno. why do we imagine, and most people do, that reading now is further east. When you've never seen, map or a globe that's shown you that. Never, ever, ever. Yeah. >> Because it's farther from the ocean. >> Because it's farther from the ocean because. 'Cause in our mind, we go California's way out there, right? There's nothing, you know, Hawaii's the only way. And out there, farther, eat west, right? So our mind makes us answer. Despite that and that's what we think we might think we might know now. We might not be totally certain You might not bet the farm on that. Which is farther north, Philadelphia. Pennsylvania or Rome Italy. So start to think, how would you think about that? It's not something you know. I mean, nobody memorized it. is it right? But how would you begin to think? Which is probably more northern. What's your first gut? How many people like Philadelphia being more north? How many people like Rome being more north? There's a kind of a mixture of hands, OK. So the answer is-- That Rome is north of Philadelphia. mostly people will answer the Philadelphia's north. Why they do that is They think the US and Europe, they're both sort of above the equator, below Antarctica, kind of a one. or even sort of historically, culturally. So they think, well, Rome is pretty-- South in Europe and it is. It's in Italy. Philadelphia is reasonably North in the U.S. It gets winter. and all that kinds of stuff. So a northern city in the US has got to be north of a-- southern city in Europe, but in fact Europe is the whole continent has shifted up compared to US. So you won't wait to get your mind around this, which is further north, Atlanta. Chicago. All right. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. I mean, yeah, so no, it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's. Because sometimes when you do this, people go like, wait a minute, you know, all my assumptions are off, like, where am I? reality, right? Okay. Yeah. But here's one more. Two more. uh... which is further north portland or toronto now you are already learning the lesson go opposite whatever i thought I'll go opposite, right? But why do you think most people will answer the Toronto's further news? Canada's up there, U.S. is below it, but in fact, that's the mentality. map and the colors but in fact Portland in Oregon is actually north of Toronto. We'll do one last one, which is further west, which is further west. Miami, Florida, which sits all the way, you know, towards the Atlantic Ocean or Santiago, stability, which sits towards the Pacific Ocean. So most people have a mental map that North America and South America are kind of lined up like that. And so you see, well, Miami is farther east and San Diego is farther south. But in fact, South America is fairly shifted compared to North America. And Santiago is actually more eastern, or Miami is more western. one relative to the other, right? Because in our head we kind of think North and South America, they're kind of lined up. even though we never saw a globe or a map like that. So, again, kind of-- of our knowledge, guides, how we think about the world and what we believe we know. [BLANK_AUDIO] All right, so what's the point of this? It used to be called telephonic. phone, right? The story keeps changing, in part, it's hard to remember detail. In a story, people remember kind of a nugget, or what we call it, just in a psychologist, a little point. And second, what you take as a point is how you then tell the next person. The way you interpret the story is something like that. Thanks very much, that was great. (audience applauds) Again, you know, hop, you know. Two things, our memory for precise details is surprisingly modest. And how we interpret things matter changes things a lot. So now. You had four brave students demonstrating some of the limits and properties of memory. So now here's an. exercise you can do in your own seat, OK? You're just knowing yourself how you did. But here we go, I'm going to read you some words. And then, just to give you, you don't have to write anything down. If you write it down, it's no good. And then I'm going to ask you on a recognition test whether you heard a word. or not. Ready? So here's the list. So just listen and then I'll test your memory for right now. - After, here's the list, sour candy. sugar, bitter, good, taste, tooth. Nice, honey, soda, chocolate, heart. Cake, tart, pie, okay? All right, how many people heard the word sour? All right, yeah, excellent, thank you. - Chair. Candy. - Hey. - Honey. building. Sweet. Every hand up there you have a fall. It's a setup, okay? Here's the way they make these lists. It's a setup, but there's a huge lesson. In fact, You make it. debates about what are real memories, what are false memories, in court cases, in clinic cases. This is a laboratory experiment that's been testing around for lots of of ideas about how we make real memories and how we end up with false memories. So here's the-- way they made the list. They took the word sour and they took a lot of students basically like you and said, what's the first word you think of that goes with sour? And people came up with this kind of a list. Can't. and the sugar bitter good taste to nice honey soda. chocolate, heart, cake, tart pie, but they left out one word that people came up with. with a lot, the word sweet, okay? So, your mind-- You said, "Hey, this is all about things that are related to sort of sweet things." sort of in one way or another, sweet sugar, sweet candies, you know, sweet and sour. Honey is sweet, chocolate is sweet, right? So your mind imagines. It heard the word sweet and the majority of you put your hand up. that you actually heard the word sweet. Your mind imagined it was there, because that was just-- sort of what was going on that was the gist of the experience, OK? So this idea-- The idea is it's very easy because of the way memory works. We remember the gist of the story. 'cause that's what's the important part. It's hard to remember the details, but that just as an entra-- The gist was it's sweet things, so the word sweet feels like it was part of it. the memory, and we'll come back to that later on in the course. So One of the themes we'll talk about a lot in the course is both an amazing power of the human mind and an amazing power of the human mind. a peril of the human mind, and it's what psychologists call "automaticity." It's that our minds And in order to be efficient and quick, dust things automatically without thought, without-- consciousness. It lets us walk without thinking a lot about where our feet are. It lets us speak. quickly, without thinking about the syntax or the vocabulary, right? It lets us do a lot of things. of things. So that's the power of it. The peril is once When something becomes automatic, we lose control of it within ourselves. So, I need somebody at their seat who's willing to read aloud something as fast as they can when they... You see it on the computer monitor, if I can get a volunteer at your seats. Okay, all the way back there, okay. And then I'll come to you for the second one. Okay, ready? As fast as you can go one way not do enter. Okay, I couldn't trick you up Okay, but you might imagine a person might misstate that, right? Okay, was there another? Okay, ready? Here we go. Go. (audience laughing) Okay, because your mind is automatically reading. It's, you know, we have lots of evidence in psychology that you're bare-- looking at words like "the." You're assuming over those things. They're almost invisible to you. or even though they're physically present, 'cause your mind is looking for the big content, right? Who cares about the word that? Your mind is going for the essential information, and it becomes literally blind. in front of you because it knows what it's looking for. Here's a fun one. You've seen Things like this before, but it's always fun to try. It's the same principle. How many letter F's do you have? Fine in this display. [ Silence ] [ Silence ] So, can I get some numbers? 4, 5, 6, those are all good. I'm not an exact science, we're like, okay. (audience laughing) Okay, ah. Some of you may have missed one or two. two F's, right? Okay. Again, it's because your mind, your mind is automatic. You know people read at spectacular typical readers read at spectacular speeds and the way you You read a spectacular speedus. You don't look for little details. You get the big words and the big ideas. Zoom through for the big meaning, OK? And you're leaving behind what you consider to be details. Yeah. [ Inaudible ] The question was if we asked a society that didn't pronounce F's or something like that. like that. sound or something like that. Does that matter for this? Yes. It also matters a lot. Words like of our little preposition words that we don't think much about, okay? So yeah, this is-- I finish most people get, or the beginning of a word you're more likely to get. I think the pronunciation probably matters. I don't know that for sure, that's a very good thought. Certainly, hiding it in words that seem low in content for interpreting a sentence is about the best way That's why the second "the" disappeared too. It's sort of a low-content word for-- processing a sentence. OK, this is an example of what you know, but it's a nice example. example, and we can come back to it a couple of times. So let me think. We'll keep out this for one second. maybe we'll do it this way that will ask somebody at their seat who has tipped a color vision. If you're color blind, this one is not a good one for you, okay? I'm just... uh... some percentage are so uh... is somebody willing of their seat to read a lot of stuff they see in a monitor OK, thank you. Here we go. So you're going to see words that are in printed in different colors. >> Your job is to read, name aloud. The color of the ink that it's printed in. Does that make sense? So like on this F-- You would say it's red on that F on that. Is that okay? Here we go. So start here And just go. [BLANK_AUDIO] >> Great. Same thing. Read the color of the ink exactly like you were doing. - Oh. Alright, you're pretty good, alright, okay, it's supposed to slow down. down when you get the color the ink and the wrong color and it usually does but you are you are You're very good, okay. Again, if you know this from, you know, of course there's an error in it, don't ruin it for others, but think about it for yourself. So now we're going to turn to thought. There's 30 people in a room, 30 people. Just imagine you sat. You know, there's groups of 30 here. You get the month and date of each person's birthday. So it's not-- Year they were born, but you know, it could be December 1st or February 5th or something like that. What is the approximate probability that two people will have the exact same burden? there. All right. I can tell you the value. majority of people under slightly less suspicious circumstances than this. We'll answer about 10 percent. That's the vast majority. The correct answer is, OK? Why-- Do you think this has worked from Kahneman and Tversky? We'll come back to this. Why do you think-- People tend to answer 10 percent, some 30, very few people give you the method. Matically correct answer is 70. Why do they do that? Because they tend to think, "How often have I met somebody?" who has my exact birthday. And you go, not that often. It's not like every 30-- People I meet somebody says, you were born on March 3rd. I was born on March 3rd. And then you go have lunch. You go, "Hey, I was born on March 3rd." And then you go have dinner with another group and they go, "I was born on March 3rd." You go, "It's not something like that." It happens a lot, right? So you go, well, that, in real life, it doesn't seem to happen very often, but what? That's what we call a heuristic, a simple way to think about it, 'cause your experience is kind of like that. But why is that? incorrect, mathematically, for this question. The math depends on not that it's exactly your birthday. but any pair of birthdays among the 30 people. And then it goes way up. In fact, it goes to-- 50 percent and if it's 24 people, 50 percent and if you're a group of 36 people, there's and 90. percent chance just mathematically that two people will share the same birthday okay because when we're Face things that are hard to think about because there's no easy answer. tend to make sure cuts and go say, "What's the gist of my experience?" And that's what I think the answer is. Even one, a calculable answer is available. It's human-- nature to make a shortcut based on your sense of your experience. Um, so, uh, uh, there's a very interesting, I think I want to work Dan Gilbert at Harvard as a leading figure about this idea of thinking about your future. Now thinking about our future is a big thing, right? We're thinking about you know, what's the like in this course, what's the like in college, what's our friendship like, relationship. parents, what's our future career paths, what kind of life will we lead, right? Our future for something that's hugely on our mind, I mean, I think very powerfully when you're a college student or graduate. student. What's my future? And a big question that people have is, "What will make me happy?" in a deep sense. What will make me happy in a deep sense? Because that's the life I want to lead. the values I want to have, the kind of career choices and personal choices I want to make. where I will devote my time on this earth. So, must be First of all, tend to think about good things, right? Which is a positive thing. It's actually, I can tell you. OK, we'll come later in the course. It's good to think that lots of positive things are happening. It's got a nice place to be in terms of-- being a happy person. But it turns out that-- People have done studies like this, so now this is particularly sensitive for us. faculty member, but it could work for any sports team you've tried out or anything you've tried out for in your life. So what happens when we get reviewed for tenure? And you hear a bit about that. This was an easy study first. colleges to do. What they did is they called up people in the fall who were being reviewed for ten. And, you know, you get tenure or you don't. And it's a bit of a sad process. because you don't get tenure and then you don't feel happy about that and you have to call your parents and say I didn't. get tenure and your parents go, "Come on, if you just slept better, you would have gotten tenure." Remember the piano lessons you didn't take, and you go, all right, so, so, so, you know, it's - Bit of a nuisance, right? - And top of that, 'cause weirdly in academics, we tend to be super specialized. to move out of town, okay? You don't have to, but typically, then a person who doesn't continue, get a job somewhere else. There's plenty of stories of people who don't get tenure at awesome places who are junior. This is in history, OK? The tenure decisions are often wrong. But still, you'd rather get it than not-- You'd rather get into a medical school than not. You'd rather make a sports team you want to be on than not. So, here's what they found out. If they ask them, what happens if you don't get-- Everybody said, oh, it's going to be awful. It's just going to be miserable. I'm going to be such an unhappy person. Two years later-- Later the average happiness of people who didn't get tenure was equal to the average Happiness of people who did get tenure, okay? So, okay, you can say, well tenure only-- Fasteners care about tenure. How about winning the lottery, okay? You know, when if I went hundreds of thousands of dollars. There's been a lot of psychology on this, actually, in about a year to two-- The average happiness of a lottery winner who wins substantial amount of money is rated the same I hammer her as it was, the population as a whole. Yeah. Yeah, so this is, we'll come back to this, but I'll tell you. You can like this or not like this, okay? So in some parts of psychology, we measure things like reaction time to the millisecond. And that's good data, right? Our brain activation, that's good data. When you ask a person how happy they are, the only thing we can do is have you basically fill a scale from one to one. How happy are you, okay? And you could go, well, I'm a little worried about that because, you know, I hope that makes you happy or something, right? So you could say, how much can we trust? subjective reports of happiness. And that's a very good question. On the other hand, it's hard to know be better than that, right? If we measure your pulse, is that a better measure of your Appiness not you don't know your pulse could be racing because you're sad or happy scared or enthusiasm So we don't have a better one that we can think of. But psychologists do worry that sometimes people but we'll just say what they're supposed to say or they'll pretend they're happy or things like that. We have to worry about it. those things, right? So you could worry deep down, but, but a year or two later people who win huge amounts of money don't report themselves as any happier than people around them. And kind of amazingly, but I think it's deep about life. Accidents leading to quadriplegia, paraplegia, accidents that, you know, before-- Or you had such an accident, you would imagine that it would be something extremely difficult. and it can be in many ways, but by self-report, ratings of happiness return. earn to typical average populations of the same age in about three months. But what's a huge lesson here in happiness research, a huge surprise is two things. kind of bad at predicting what will make us happy or sad, which is kind of weird, right? I mean, we're kind of bad at predicting. Here's all these things where we think they would make us happy or make us happy. Not so happy. It turns out we're wrong once it's studied at all. So we'll come back to that later on because it's a very deep is what makes you happy, and your wrong guess is sometimes about what does. So let me end with the last experiment. So we've really been done experiments. until right now. And this is now a sensitive and difficult issue, which is-- dealing with racism. And here's a study that had defined It said, well, in North America certainly, Canada, the US, I studied with some in Canada. Racism is widely condemned, as I think most of us believe it should be. But examples of blatant racism still occur in one recent Paul said that about a third of white individuals reported hearing anti-black slurs in the workplace. in the last couple of years, to pick one thing. So how does this happen in a society? speaks so much about not being racist, about treating everybody equally. fairly and kindly. How does it happen that we still struggle? That's a very deep, difficult question. a human nature in the world we live in. But here's something, again, about this. That's a-- about why it's hard to get society to change some of its behaviors. So here's the experiment, OK? It's an actual experiment. So they took two groups of-- college undergraduates, and randomly assign one to be in the forecaster group. group that tells you how they think they would feel and how they think they would act under certain circumstance. And then an experiencer group. That's a group-- actually undergoes an experience and I'll tell you what that is now. So in the experience, group, pretend you were their research participant, you walk into a room, and you see in the that room, a black male and a white male. Now, those two are what psychologists, for some reason, called Confederates. Those are role players. They know what they're doing, okay? They're They have a plan of what they're gonna do. They're gonna put on a little show for you. But you don't know that, okay? And the black male stands up and leaves the room to get his cell phone any day. gently bumps the white male's knee. This is all set up. OK, you're just sitting there and you see that little bump. And now there's three different groups. One group, that's it, nothing else. A small bump on the person leaves. A second group, as a user. sit there, the black individual leaves the room and the white individual says, "typical I hate it when black people do that. It's meant to be obviously provocative and racist. And then, where they consider an extreme slur, the white person in the room playing this role says, uses a-- the derogatory word that's meant to be an extreme slur. So there's one more thing you need to know now you're sitting there and you're Either in the control group, or there's been a slight bump, or there's been a moderate slur, or-- extreme slur in their words. The black male returns, don't forget he's in on it and so that white male, but you're not in on it. You just think there was a bump, and something else may have happened depending on which condition. you're in. And the experimenter then gives you a survey about how you feel right now. Sort of like the happiness, but it's not that. It's like, how do you feel right now? And then ask you to pick-- between those two people, a partner for an anagram experiment that you're about to do. OK. So they're going to ask you-- this is sort of the question here. What's the-- difference or similarity between what you say your feeling is and what you really-- They do. Both things are important, but do they line up? Do they not line up? OK, so here's the-- here's the-- results. Here's a graph and here's how this works. Negative emotional stress. The higher the bar The more you say, "I feel really bad about what's just happened." Okay, I just heard this comment. or no comment. So let's take a look, hire the bar. If you heard no comments, here's how you begin. So let's start with the forecasters. All of you are forecasters. Because you're pretending you're in the situation, but you're not in it, right? So there was no comments. Okay, that's sort of average or something. And then you said, if you heard a racial slur, you would feel. terrible. You would feel terrible. But look at the other students who are randomly picked. We don't think it's a difference among students. Look at these. gray bars. They're pretty flat. Okay? The person on the spot. It's somehow not processing this and they're filling out. I feel average, okay? Because you see the split between the values of the values of the values of the values. use of the person thinks they would have and the values that are responded to on the spot And what we'll talk about later on in social psychology is there's a tough gap. often between the values we espouse, and how we act when especially unexpected, difficult things, okay? And very often, if you've had any experience. like this afterwards you go oh what I should have done is this or I wish I would have said that but that moment is not happening at that moment, probably because you're kind of weirded out by the whole thing, like what's going on? that for some say this, something doesn't seem right. I can't kind of sort it out. And so people tend to-- shrink in terms of making a strong conclusion of what's going on if something seems unusually. Provocative and you could say well, okay, that's their attitudes, but how about their action? Who do they pick to be their part? And again, the people of forecasting said if I was in this situation, I Never pick. I would never pick that racist white person to be my partner. OK, because that person stinks, OK? If I was in that situation. But if the people are in the situation, look at the gray bars. Pretty flat. It says if on the spot, in the moment, they can't quite process it. the values they feel and the action they're going to take. And we'll talk about-- It's very hard, often, in part to be brave and stand up to things. there's a lot of evidence for this. It's a human nature thing. It's very hard to be brave. and stand up to things when things are kinda weird, 'cause almost every of the first things, like I don't wanna make a fool of myself. if I don't want to make trouble. Maybe I'm not getting the whole picture on this, and we shrink back from-- acting in a way that aligns with the values that are clearly shown here. OK? So this, again, is something about human nature. That's very weird. And it's so-- It's very powerful to come into social psychology. That's why it's very hard to stand up to things like oppression and violence. I guess it's very hard to do. Because we tend to not act on our values. when we're in complicated situations on the spot. And there's a tremendous amount of evidence So again, how we interpret the situation very different in our mind when we Agent were there, and when we actually sit there. So what these research has says, this It's currently why it's been hard to sort of eradicate some vestiges of stereotype. and racism because people have a hard time clamping and down on it in the moment. Um, so, uh, so that's a tough topic. But, you know, we want- I deal with things that are less controversial, but also things that touch people's lives. the world that we live in. So we talked about the scientific study of the human nature, mind and behavior. how what we see and hear is determined somewhat. by how our mind interprets the world around us, how we remember things like word lists or stories. It's usually influenced by what we expect to see, like in the picture, how we think we know. things like where Reno is compared to San Francisco, how we think about things like the probability So we'll have somebody else, we'll have the same birthday that somebody else will in a group. And the relationship-- between how we feel and how we act. The very feelings we have are often disconnected. actions in the moment, and sometimes it has a sort of a difficult consequence. So we'll explore all these things through this semester, all the different facets that we could possibly get through once a semester. It is to be human, and where science has showed us something about human nature, the mind, and the brain. You You You
